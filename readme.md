## Code Standards and Best Practices

To ensure consistent coding style, quality, and workflows across the project, we use **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **Husky**. This document outlines how to set up, run, and adhere to these standards.

---

### 1. Code Style and Formatting

We enforce coding standards using:

-   **ESLint**: For detecting and fixing common coding errors.
-   **Prettier**: For automatic code formatting.

#### **Setup**

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Confirm ESLint and Prettier are configured correctly:

-   ESLint: **.eslintrc.json**
-   Prettier: **.prettierrc**

#### **Running ESLint**

To check for linting issues:Running ESLint
To check for linting issues:

bash
Copy code
npm run lint
To automatically fix linting issues:

bash
Copy code
npm run lint -- --fix
Running Prettier
To format the codebase:

bash
Copy code
npm run format

#### 2. Pre-Commit Hooks

We use Husky and lint-staged to ensure code quality before committing changes.

How It Works
On every commit, lint-staged runs ESLint and Prettier on changed files.
If issues are found, the commit will fail until they are resolved.
Manual Setup (Optional)
If youâ€™re setting up the project for the first time, run:

bash
Copy code
npx husky install
What Happens on Commit
ESLint runs to check for errors.
Prettier formats the code.
If all checks pass, the commit is created.
